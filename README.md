## Instacart Sales and Market Analysis

## Project Summary
This repository emulates the analysis of a fictitious online supermarket's orders data (Instacart), which operates through an app.  
The goal of the analyst in this project is to uncover more information about their sales patterns and consumer behavior. The task is to perform initial and exploratory analysis in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better market segmentation. 

The assumption of this exercise is that Instacart wants t o target different kinds of customers with marketing campaigns and see whether they have an effect on sales. The analysis aims to inform what this strategy might look like. 

The metrics analyzed in this repository range, but are not limited to identifying spending patterns across time, most successfully performing departments, and differences in consumer behavior depending on their brand loyalty, family status, age, income and region.  

## Key Project Questions 
- What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?
- At what times do customers spend the most money?
- With Instacart’s wide range of product prices, what recommendations can simplify price range groupings to better guide marketing efforts?
- Are there specific types of products that are more popular than others?
- How is brand loyalty distributed among users?
- Do ordering habits vary based on a customer’s loyalty status?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
- Is there a connection between age and family status regarding ordering habits?
- What classifications can be derived from demographic information, such as age, income, types of goods, and family status?
- How do ordering habits differ among various customer profiles?
